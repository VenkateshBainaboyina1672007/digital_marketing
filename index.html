            <p class="para">A direct selling business is a sales channel where products are marketed directly to consumers outside of a traditional retail store, such as at home, work, or online. This model bypasses intermediaries like wholesalers and retailers, often relying on a network of independent salespeople, sometimes called consultants or distributors, to build relationships with customers. Direct selling can include models like single-level marketing (income solely from personal sales) and multi-level marketing (income from personal sales and recruiting others). </p>
